# Why did you do this? What have you done?

I was bored and I have not done front-end web development in months, so I am remaking the front end of Nobody[dot]Live but with CSS grid, 

Q: Why CSS grid? 

A: Why not? CSS grid is still pretty new to me, so this is good practice for me so that I can better learn how to use grid, also I kinda really wanna try to mimic the layout of youtube, just with Twitch streams, 

Q: Plans? 

A: Once I figure out how to I might do more with this, but for now I am probily mostly done, except for finishing touches fixing the grid, and styles :) this is just more practice of CSS grid for me, using an already made concept as a base, also, I do have a plan to add the search diolouge, but not quite yet, lol
