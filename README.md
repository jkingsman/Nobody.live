## Questions Answered

Q: Why is this fork using a mirrored copy of the currently live site? 

A: Well I am a front end web developer and because of that I have a hard time understanding how to setup a database and all of that, so instead I mirrored the current site and mirgrated the changed from the current (Maybe unreleased) version on Github over, making a few manual changes (Such as always showing the MOTD) that _in the server_ would not be needed, also I am just too lazy and I would rather use PHP server. 

Q: How do I setup this for a quick preview?

A: On Linux and MacOS just change your terminal into the directory and then run your faviourite testing server, mine is php server, I run ```php -S 0.0.0.0:8080``` for mine and then i navigate to ```localhost:8080``` in my browser.
